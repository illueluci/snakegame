# snakegame
from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dfePlONtls

modifications :
-out of bounds check
-prevention of moving backwards (if snake is going up, cannot go down). Still not completely foolproof, sharp u-turn is possible (and obviously causes game over)
-music now loops
-trying to implement golden apple
